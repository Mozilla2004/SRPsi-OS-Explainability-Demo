  "interpretation": {
    "C_s_meaning": "Structural coherence is strong. Concept mapping is consistent and narrative aligns well with causal chain.",
    "R_s_meaning": "Rhythmic stability is good. Entropy trend is positive with moderate omega stability.",
    "Psi_s_meaning": "Phase alignment is acceptable but has room for improvement. Geometry alignment is slightly lagging.",
    "status_meaning": "System is stable but not yet in 'improving' state (requires all metrics > 0.75)"
